# Technology Management Enhancement

## New Features Added

### 1. Create New Technologies While Typing

When creating a project, you can now:
- **Search existing technologies**: Start typing to see matching technologies from the database
- **Add new technologies**: If no exact match is found, you'll see an option to "Add [technology] as new technology"
- **Press Enter**: Hit Enter to create the technology you've typed
- **Use comma separation**: Type multiple technologies separated by commas (e.g., "React, Node.js, Python")
- **Paste multiple**: Paste comma-separated technologies from clipboard

### 2. Enhanced User Interface

- **Visual feedback**: Loading state when creating new technologies
- **Distinct styling**: New technology option has different styling with a plus icon
- **Smart duplicate detection**: Prevents adding the same technology twice
- **Auto-close dropdown**: Clicking outside closes the dropdown

### 3. Backend API

New endpoint: `/create_technology/`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Body**: `{"name": "Technology Name"}`
- **Response**: `{"id": 123, "name": "Technology Name", "message": "Technology created successfully"}`
